### About me:

I started my path as a frontend developer at 2022 when I left my banking career. I've been studying at ITgirls school as frontend developer. About a year ago I've known Webflow so I switched to webflow developing and currently I work as webflow developer on Upwork freelance. My clients are mainly web agencies and I develop websites according to their Figma designs. I often use basic JavaScript code and different JS libraries at my projects such as GSAP, Lenis etc.
My goal is to improve my JavaScript knowledge and find a job as Junior frontend developer.
